Goal

Build a creator-first Brand Deal CRM that helps individual creators & influencers manage:

Brand deals

Deal pipeline

Contracts

Payments

Earnings analytics

Smart reminders

The product must be simple, fast, and production-ready, not enterprise-heavy.

Target User

Solo creators & influencers

10k–500k followers

Instagram / YouTube focused

No agencies, no brands

Tech Stack (STRICT)

Frontend: Next.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

Backend: FastAPI

Database: PostgreSQL

Auth: Supabase Auth

File storage: Cloudflare R2 (or S3)

Charts: Recharts

Deployment-ready code

CORE MVP FEATURES (DO NOT ADD MORE)
1. Deal Pipeline (Core Feature)

Implement a Kanban board with stages:

Lead

Negotiation

Signed

Content Delivered

Paid

Each deal must store:

Brand name

Platform (Instagram, YouTube, etc.)

Deal value

Deadline

Status

Notes

Provide:

Create / edit / delete deals

Drag & drop between stages

2. Earnings & Payment Tracking

Each deal can have multiple payments:

Amount

Paid / pending status

Payment date

Mode (optional)

Dashboard analytics:

Total earnings (lifetime)

Earnings this month

Pending payments

Brand-wise earnings

Platform-wise earnings

Use simple charts (line + bar).

3. Contract Vault (Lite)

Upload contract PDFs

Store:

Usage rights end date

Exclusivity end date

Display contracts linked to deals

No AI contract analysis in MVP

4. Smart Reminders

Implement reminder types:

Email notifications only

Background job / cron-based
